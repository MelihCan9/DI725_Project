# DI725_Project

This repository has been created to support Phase 1 deliverables of the DI 725 final project **“Vision–Language Models for Image Captioning”** at Middle East Technical University. The focus of this phase is on conducting a comprehensive literature survey, defining a clear research question, proposing a methodology for fine‑tuning the PaliGemma foundation model on the RISC remote‑sensing dataset, and performing preliminary data exploration.
